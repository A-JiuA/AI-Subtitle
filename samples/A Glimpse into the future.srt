ladies and gentlemen. do you know people who post pictures of themselves almost every day snap like my new watch snap west lake in spring and snap here's me middle of a speech competition from streets to campuses. people are obsessed with taking photos of themselves. 

2
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:29,410
but when photography was first introduced to china in nineteenth century, it traumatized a generation. 

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,210
with a draw tube shaped like a cannon, the dazzling firework at exposure like that. 

4
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:42,869
and most horrifying of all the bizarre feeling of her own face staring back at you on a piece of paper and. 

5
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,920
witchcraft, they say an evil ritual taken away our spirits. 

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,380
as the development of technology moves, the will of history forward. 

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,049
it was always accompanied by fear. 

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:17,519
judging in retrospect from the era of selfie craze, of course. we would want to tell those benighted people of the past if you're not yourself. won't be sucked into a camera and this is exactly what i want to tell people of the present fear, not because when technology revolutionize our lives, humanity frames. 

9
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,769
look at our world now. 

10
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:34,560
the debate between scientists and humanists never seem to set our minds at rest when scientists are bragging about generalizing five g sixty. the humans say you're providing easy ways to infringe on personal privacy. 

11
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,349
when scientists. 

12
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,010
brag the ai as humans ultimate assistant. 

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,930
the civil writer say we're where they might develop consciousness of their own. 

14
00:01:46,409 --> 00:02:09,819
once i a self proclaimed, the physicist talked to my powers from the school of humanities about teleportation is that theoretically we can transport anything from here to there instantly by disintegrating the stuff here and reconstructing an identical one there, but i was instantly bombarded with so soon you are going to transport people in this way, would you. 

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:30,810
but we won't be the same person after teleport. will my consciousness be instantly terminated upon disintegration here, leaving only a duplicate of me to be reconstructed there so innocent bystanders upon hearing these fantastic debates panic oh no, the geese are going to read our meals. the robots are going to take off the earth. 

16
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,900
teleportation is going to destroy thousands of people every day, leaving a word full of clothes. 

17
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,650
but none of this. 

18
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,530
is actually going to happen. 

19
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,900
because humanists are not alarmists and scientists are not geeks. 

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:58,310
humanists point out part and ethical issues with the hope of correcting them, and scientists listen to their suggestions rationally to make adjustments as well as amendments. 

21
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:08,550
just like the first pioneer who modified the camera to make it less scary, we can always improve technology with humanitarian care. 

22
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,490
we can enhance the security of networks by introducing quantum cryptography. 

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:30,310
we can put restrictions on a.i. to prevent rogue elements as for teleportation or maybe it's too risky to transport humans, but we can still relieve a considerable burden of beijing traffic by taking care of the delivery system. 

24
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,539
so taking a glimpse into the future. what exactly do i see. 

25
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:44,270
not the ai rain dystopia where humans are reduced to slaves. not the post apocalypse desert after a nuclear war. 

26
00:03:44,449 --> 00:04:09,530
but a future where humanity thrive with technology as its instrument of success and technologies right with humanity as its code of conduct. just like how we market nineteenth century people for being fearful in front of a camera, our future generations were also we wondering why we had feared some of their daily routines in the first place as they reach ever high dimensions and rome across the stars. thank you. 

27
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,909
think your contestant.
