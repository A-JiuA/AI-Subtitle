1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,109
所以我过着孤独的生活。
so i lived my life alone. 

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,309
没有一个可以真正倾诉的人。
without anyone that i could really talk to. 

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,189
直到六年前我的飞机在撒哈拉沙漠出了事故。
until i had an accident with my plane in the desert of sahara six years ago. 

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,970
我的引擎坏了。
something was broken in my engine. 

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,739
我身边既没有机械师，也没有乘客。
and as i had with me, neither a mechanic nor any passengers. 

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,660
我决心独自完成这项艰巨的修理工作。
i set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. 

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:31,000
这对我来说是生死攸关的问题。我几乎没有足够维持一个星期的饮用水。
it was a question of life or death for me. i had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week. 

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,549
那么，第一晚。
the first night, then. 

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:39,100
我在远离人烟千里之外的沙滩上睡着了。
i went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation. 

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,950
我比一个在大海中围着木筏漂流的遇难水手还要孤独。
i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor around the raft in the middle of the ocean. 

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,509
因此，你可以想象，当我在日出时被一个点头的小男孩叫醒时，我有多么惊讶。
thus, you can imagine my amazement at sunrise when i was awakened by a nod little boys. 

12
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:56,619
它说如果你给我画一只羊。
it said if you please draw me a sheep. 

13
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:57,909
什么。
what. 

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,929
给我画一只羊。
draw me a sheep. 

15
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,469
我像晴天霹雳一样一下子跳了起来。
i jumped to my feet completely thunderstruck. 

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:07,890
我眨眨眼睛，心。我仔细地环顾四周。
i'd blink to my eyes heart. i looked carefully all around me. 

17
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:14,930
我看到一个非常不寻常的小个子站在那里，非常严肃地审视着我。
and i saw a most extraordinary small person who stood there examining me with great seriousness. 

18
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:20,099
在这里你可以看到我后来能画出的最好的他的肖像。
here you may see the best portrait that later i was able to make of him. 

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,030
但我的画当然没有它的模特迷人。
but my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. 

20
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,079
然而，这不是我的错。
that, however, is not my fault. 

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:41,629
在我六岁的时候，大人们让我在画师生涯中灰心丧气，除了从外面画凉亭和从里面画凉亭之外，我从来没有学过画任何东西。
the grown ups discouraged me in my painters career when i was six years old and i never learnt to draw anything except bowers from the outside and bowers from the inside. 

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,569
现在，我惊奇地望着这个突然出现的怪物，眼睛都吓得从脑袋里瞪出来了。
now i stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. 

23
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,709
记住，我坠落在沙漠里，离任何有人居住的地方都有一千英里远。
remember, i had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. 

24
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:04,950
然而，我的小家伙似乎既没有在沙漠中迷失方向，也没有因为疲劳、饥饿、口渴或恐惧而昏倒。
and yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. 

25
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:13,360
从他身上丝毫看不出他是一个迷失在远离人烟的沙漠中的孩子。
nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any human habitation. 

26
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,069
当我终于能说话的时候。我对他说，但是。
when at last i was able to speak. i said to him, but. 

27
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,090
你在这里做什么?
what are you doing here. 

28
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,430
他非常缓慢地重复着回答。
and in answer he repeated very slowly. 

29
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,020
好像他在说一件事关重大的事。
as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence. 

30
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,250
请给我画一只羊。
if you please draw me a sheep. 

31
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,000
当一个谜太强大，一个人不敢不服从。
when a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. 

32
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:42,680
在我看来，这是荒谬的，因为它远离人类的居住地，处于死亡的危险中。
absurd as it might seem to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death. 

33
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,800
我从口袋里掏出一张纸和一支钢笔。
i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen. 

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:03:00,580
但这时我想起我的学习重点是地理、历史、算术和语法，我也有点生气地告诉这个小家伙，我不会画画。
but then i remembered how my studies have been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar and i tell the little chap a little crossly too that i did not know how to draw. 

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,560
他回答我。这并不重要。给我画一只羊。
he answered me. that doesn't matter. draw me a sheep. 

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,180
但我从来没有画过羊。于是我给他画了我经常画的两幅画中的一幅。
but i had never drawn a sheep. so i drew for him one of the two pictures i had drawn so often. 

37
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,039
那是一只从外面来的蟒蛇。
it was that of a boa constricter from the outside. 

38
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:25,939
当我听到这个小家伙说不，不，不，我不想在蟒蛇的肚子里放一头大象时，我大吃一惊。
and i was astounded to hear the little fellow greeted with no, no, no, i do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. 

39
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:38,360
蟒蛇是一种非常危险的生物，而大象在我住的地方是非常笨重的。所有东西都很小。我需要一只羊，给我画一只羊。
a boa constructor is a very dangerous creature and an elephant is very cumbersome where i live. everything is very small. what i need is a sheep, draw me a sheep. 

40
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,139
然后我画了一幅画。
so then i made a drawing. 

41
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,909
他仔细地看了看，然后说。
he looked at it carefully, then he said. 

42
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,990
不行，这只羊已经病得很重了。让我另一个。
no, this sheep is already very sickly. make me another. 

43
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,430
所以我又制造了另一个欢乐。
so i made another joy. 

44
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,870
我的朋友温和而宽容地笑了。
my friend smiled gently and indulgently. 

45
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,689
你看到你自己。他说这不是一只羊。这是一只公羊，它有角。
you see yourself. he said that this is not a sheep. this is a ram, it has horns. 

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,250
于是我又重新画了一遍。
so then i did my drawing over once more. 

47
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,939
但他也被拒绝了，就像其他人一样。
but he was rejected too, just like the others. 

48
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,170
这个太旧了。
this one is too old. 

49
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:28,269
我想要一只活得很长的羊。我的耐心已经耗尽了，因为我急着开始拆引擎。
i want a sheep that will live a long time by this time. my patience was exhausted because i was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. 

50
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,970
我说服了陪审团。
i tossed off this jury. 

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,699
我给出了一个解释。
and i threw out an explanation with it. 

52
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,779
这只是他的箱子，你要的羊就在里面。
this is only his box the sheep you asked for is inside. 

53
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,220
我非常惊讶地看到我的年轻法官脸上绽开了一丝光芒。
i was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge. 

54
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,149
这正是我想要的。
that is exactly the way i wanted it. 

55
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,829
你认为这只羊需要很多草吗?
do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass. 

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,319
为什么。
why. 

57
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,079
因为在我住的地方，一切都很小。
because where i live, everything is very small. 

58
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:03,930
肯定有足够的草给他吃。我说我给你的是一只很小的羊。
there will surely be enough grass for him. i said it is a very small sheep that i have given you. 

59
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,509
他俯下头看那幅画。
he bent his head over the drawing. 

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,399
没小到你看，他已经睡着了。
not so small that look, he has gone to sleep. 

61
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:16,519
我就这样认识了小王子。
and that is how i made the acquaintance of the little prince.
